        "The first 10.5 MM rows are trained and validated with a 9:1 ratio and the last 500 rows are tested for accuracy, precision, recall and ROC score metrics, not unlike the classification models we ran previously. With the use of tools such as Tensorflow, we can optimize parameters for number of layers, neurons (units), activation function, batch size, kernel initializer, optimizer, learning rate, epsilon, decay rate, and dropout rate. With these optimized parameters, the final model will expand the the number of default epochs from 20 to 500 with early stopping to find the highest ROC score. \n",

        "To give a little more detail on the parameters we are looking to optimize, see below:\n",

        "* No. of Layers - While a single layer can be used to learn problems, utilizing multiple layers allows us to ease the process of our models learning using multilayer perceptrons. \n",
        "* No. of Neurons - like layers, add to the complexity of a model in helping it learn\n",
        "* Activation Function - part of a node that defines the output of that node given a set of inputs. \n",
        "* Batch Size - number of training examples in one forward/backward pass\n",
        "* Kernel Initializer - define the way to set the initial random weights of keras layers\n",
        "* Optimizer - one of two artguments required for compiling a keras module\n",
        "* Learning Rate - a function that takes an epoch index and current learning rate (float) as inputs and returns a new learning rate\n",
        "* Epsilon - the value of the fuzz factor used in numeric expression\n",
        "* Decay Rate - reducing an amount by a consistent peercentage rate over a period of time. \n",
        "* Dropout Rate - excluding random inputs from each update cycle to ensure optimization. "
